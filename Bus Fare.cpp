You are given a list of sorted integers days , where you must take the bus for on each day. Return the lowest cost it takes to travel for all the days.

There are 3 types of bus tickets.

    1 day pass for 2 dollars
    7 day pass for 7 dollars
    30 day pass for 25 dollars

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of days

Example 1
Input

days = [1, 3, 4, 5, 29]

Output

9

Explanation

The lowest cost can be achieved by purchasing a 7 day pass in the beginning and then a 1 day pass on the 29th day.
Example 2
Input

days = [1]

Output

2

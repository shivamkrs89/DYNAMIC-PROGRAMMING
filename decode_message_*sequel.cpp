Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, as well as "*" which can be mapped anything from 1 to 9, and an encoded message message (as a string), count the number of ways it can be decoded.

Mod the result by 10 ** 9 + 7.

Constraints

    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of message

Example 1
Input

message = "1*"

Output

18

Explanation

The "*" can represent anything from 1 to 9, so this can be decoded as:

    ["aa", "ab", "ac", "ad", "ae", "af", "ag", "ah", "ai"] - (1, 1), (1, 2), ..., (1, 9)`
    ["k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s"] (11), (12), ..., (19)

Example 2
Input

message = "22"

Output

2

Explanation

This can represent "bb" or "v"
Example 3
Input

message = "*00"

Output

0

Explanation

There's no valid decoding

      cases: ***,1**,0**,**0,123*2

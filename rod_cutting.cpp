You are given a list of integers prices where prices[i] represents the price to sell a rod of size i + 1, and an integer n which represents the current size of the rod.

Given you can cut the rod into any number of different sizes, return the maximum profit that can be earned.

Constraints

    m = n â‰¤ 1000 where m is the length of prices.

Example 1
Input

prices = [1, 3, 5, 7, 7, 7]

n = 6

Output

10

Explanation

The price table shows that we can

    Sell a rod of size 1 for price of 1
    Sell a rod of size 2 for price of 3
    Sell a rod of size 3 for price of 5
    Sell a rod of size 4 for price of 7
    Sell a rod of size 5 for price of 7
    Sell a rod of size 6 for price of 7

The optimal way to cut the rod is to split it into 2 pieces of length 3, to achieve profit of 10.

      //code
      int solve(vector<int>& prices, int n) {
   int len=n;
   n=prices.size();
   int i,j;
   int dp[len+1];

   memset(dp,0,sizeof(dp));

   for(i=1;i<=n;i++)
   {
       for(j=i;j<=len;j++)
       {
           dp[j]=max(dp[j],prices[i-1]+dp[j-i]);  //checking for already existing dp[j] of given length and when we take current 1 and subtract the len j-i
       }
   }

   return dp[len];

}
